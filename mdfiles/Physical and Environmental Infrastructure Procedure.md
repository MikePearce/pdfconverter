1 Overview 
MyTutor has a large and complex ICT infrastructure. The foundation of this structure is the 
Data and Communications Network which is facilitated and supported by many types of 
hardware including extensive cabling and supporting systems installed throughout 
MyTutor’s various buildings and offices.  
 
Physical and environmental security often provides the first line of defence of information 
and information systems with what might be called geographic or area security, with 
equipment security and general controls to protect physical assets. 
2 Scope 
The scope of these procedures includes all persons/parties who have access to MyTutor buildings, 
locations, information and ICT systems belonging to or under the control of MyTutor including: 
 
•  MyTutor employees 
•  Contractors 
•  Temporary staff 
•  Partner organisations 
•  Any other party utilising MyTutor ICT resources 
3 Purpose 
These  procedures  define  the  requirements  to  ensure  that  MyTutor’s  critical  or  sensitive 
information  processing  facilities  are  in  secure  areas  and  protected  by  a  defined  secure 
perimeter. Appropriate security and controls provide protection against unauthorised access or 
damage to information available within processing facilities.  
  
The following procedures are closely linked to and should be read and used in conjunction with 
the Network security procedures, Desktop PC Security procedures, Password policies, and 
Internet and email policies. 
 
 
 
4  Procedures 
4.1  Three spheres of principal control 
There are three spheres of principal control that are available and when used in conjunction can 
supplement  and  enhance  the  overall  assurance  of  MyTutor’s  physical  and  environmental 
infrastructure.

The three controls are: 
 
  Physical  
  Technical 
  Procedural. 
  
1.  Physical controls rely on the presence of physical limitations to secure the perimeter or 
environment (Buildings and locations) containing information and information processing 
facilities. Stopping unauthorised people from entering/breaking into buildings (Fire escapes, 
back  doors),  the  use  of  locks  on  offices,  server  rooms,  other  sensitive  areas  and  the 
willingness to challenge those who aren’t wearing badges.  Further to this, what to do if 
something does go wrong e.g. there is a break in, a location suffers a fire or the power 
supply fails. 
 
2.  Technical security involves security measures that employ technology in some way. Usually 
they are related to computers and software techniques but can equally apply to technical 
locks such as tokens or biometric techniques such as finger prints. They can extend to 
hardware through locking of ports or to some other technological solution for a specific 
application (e.g. MyTutor’s VPN).  
 
3.  Procedural security covers the rules, regulations and policies that an organisation puts in 
place to help reduce the risk of issues arising e.g. obligatory policies such as internet and 
email, password protection, PC and network security.  
 
A layered approach using all three types of security provides the best solution. A set of controls need 
to be effectively implemented such as:- 
 
  Controls getting into the site, buildings or locations (Procedural and physical.) 
  A set of well drafted and effectively policed policies, of which staff are well aware. 
For example, staff are aware of where and how to store, send or copy sensitive 
information and ensure encryption is used if necessary (Procedural and technical.) 
  Physical,  technical  and  procedural  controls  surrounding  access  to  information 
processing  systems.  For  example  Specific  logons  /  access  technology  to  ICT 
equipment, systems and applications. 
  Physical, technical and procedural controls to ensure safety, security and integrity of 
information and locations e.g. fire procedures, power failures, eating and drinking, 
back-up equipment, location of critical equipment. 
  Business continuity plans and disaster recovery plans must exist to counteract any 
loss of critical equipment, infrastructure and / or data.  
  Maintenance contracts and service level agreements that incorporate, for example: 
antivirus software, encryption, security breach reporting mechanisms. 
 
4.2  Physical and Environment Procedures 
 
MyTutor Infrastructure equipment is maintained and installed across most MyTutor buildings and 
locations e.g. network cables in cupboards, network connection points, PC's and printers, servers,

internet routers. Access to computers and devices must be controlled using secure methods and 
procedures in order to prevent damage to MyTutor assets and reputation. 
 
1.  Appropriate recording mechanisms need to be in place to record the names, dates, times 
and signatures for the signing in and out of visitors (Including MyTutor’s personnel) to 
MyTutor locations. All visitors must be issued with an authorised MyTutor visitor’s badge 
when signing in and upon leaving any badges issued should be collected to prevent access by 
the employee/visitor at a later date. 
 
2.  Staff should wear their MyTutor ID badges and visitors must wear the Visitor ID badges) if 
needed, which have been issued to them and they must be supervised at all times when 
visiting secure areas and leaving these areas. People who are not displaying ID badges 
should be challenged. Any person not known to personnel must be challenged in order to 
establish who they are and whether authorisation has been provided for them to be there. If 
there  is  any  doubt  about  the  identity  of  the  individual,  the  appropriate  security 
officer/manager should be contacted to confirm the individual’s identity. 
 
3.  Locations housing critical or sensitive information and/or information processing facilities 
should have a secure, physically sound perimeter with suitable controls and restrictions 
allowing access to authorised staff only. CCTV and audible alarm systems should be active in 
areas where critical servers are located as required, such as in the data centre and should be 
periodically reviewed to ensure they are operating as intended. 
 
4.  Observance and maintenance of the physical security of rooms and offices where PC's 
and/or  critical  information  processing  equipment  is  located  needs  to  be  a  paramount 
consideration. For example, do not house critical equipment in publicly accessible locations, 
close to windows, in areas where theft is a high risk. Locate servers and business critical 
equipment in locations with adequate environmental and fire controls.  
 
5.  MyTutor ICT equipment may only be used by authorised parties for authorised MyTutor 
business or purposes in accordance with MyTutor’s Acceptable Use policy and associated 
security policies.  
 
6.  Desktop PC's, laptops and CTO which have not been provided by MyTutor but have been 
approved for use may be subject to the relevant security checks and procedures by the IT 
Department and Internal Audit. 
 
7.  All ICT equipment, data and communication networks must be installed and maintained 
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and in line with all relevant MyTutor policies and 
procedures. 
 
8.  All  MyTutor  PC's,  laptops  and  CTO  will  be  distributed  and  maintained  to  ensure  the 
minimum standards of software and hardware integrity and security. This will include the 
correct security configuration and initial and regularly updated protection from viruses, 
spyware/malware. 
 
9.  Network Support staff working remotely must observe the same controls and procedures as 
when working within MyTutor campus in order to ensure security and integrity and to 
prevent loss and/or damage to MyTutor assets and reputation.

10. Access to  information  processing  systems will only  be  allocated  to  staff  following  any 
required legal / MyTutor checks. If required, usage policies will also need to be signed by 
staff.  
 
11. All interfaces used for managing system administration and enabling access to information 
processing must be appropriately secured. 
 
12. Maintenance of MyTutor equipment and infrastructure will be carried out by IT Department 
authorised staff.   
 
13. Access to and knowledge of key fobs, door lock codes or access to keys for locks, are 
restricted to authorised personnel only and must not be shared with any unauthorised 
person.  
 
14. ICT equipment should be taken off site only if permission for this has been agreed. Extreme 
care regarding loss, damage or theft needs to be employed whilst the equipment is off site. 
Staff must adhere to any relevant procedures and guidance regarding the use of and security 
of ICT equipment being used off site. 
 
15. Access codes used for secure locking mechanisms must be changed on a regular basis as 
specified  by  the  location  manager  in  line  with  professional  best  practice  especially  in 
instances where there has been a change in personnel, for example staff leaving.  
 
16. If electronic door locks/key fobs are in use they must be issued to authorised staff on an 
individual basis, be fully registered to that individual and only used by that individual. The 
key fob must be deactivated immediately when no longer required and registration details 
updated accordingly. Any key fobs that are not being used should be securely stored and a 
separate record maintained of these fobs. 
 
17. Direct access to secure locations, or access to adjoining offices which could provide access, 
must be locked and secured using appropriate locking mechanisms. 
 
18. Doors  which  provide  access  to  ICT  Network  Infrastructure  equipment  must  not  to  be 
left/wedged  open  unless  for  the  purpose  of  taking  delivery  of  new  equipment,  to 
accommodate  the  movement  of  existing  equipment,  transportation  of maintenance  or 
cleaning equipment – an authorised member of staff must be present at all times to 
supervise access when doors are left open. 
 
19. All  MyTutor/Contracted  Cleaners  must  have  and  display  appropriate  identification  as 
required and be made aware of the requirements within this procedure. 
 
20. Personal, special access visits from relatives or acquaintances of personnel are not permitted 
within secure areas. There must be a valid reason for all visits and any such visitors must go 
through the standard signing in/out procedure as required. 
 
21. Consideration and understanding of health and safety guidelines/procedures should be 
followed to ensure security, integrity and safety of MyTutor’s data and communications 
infrastructure. Smoke detectors should be located within the areas housing critical system

and  applications  with  fire-fighting  equipment  maintained  and  periodically  tested. Local 
operations  staff should  be  provided  with  basic  training  in  the  use  of  fire  suppressant 
equipment.  
 
22. If it is suspected that any of the above procedures have been broken or compromised, then 
the concern should be placed before a senior manager or use the Security Incident Form to 
report the matter.  
 
23. A business continuity plan and disaster recovery procedures must be in place in the event of 
the loss of a part, or the whole MyTutor Data and Communications Network infrastructure. 
Procedural documentation must be regularly updated to include any changes/updates to 
existing procedures or processes involved. 
 
24. Data  and  Communications  Network  Infrastructure  Fault  Tolerance  and  Redundancy 
procedures must be in place and tested for effectiveness on a regular basis. Procedural 
documentation must be regularly updated to include any changes or updates. 
 
25. Equipment should be sited to minimise unnecessary, unauthorised access into work areas. 
For example, refreshment units or office machinery designed for visitors should be placed in 
public accessible areas only.  
 
26. ICT property and equipment should be indelibly marked. A full inventory of assets and their 
location is maintained and can identify the importance of each item to assist in the case of 
items being lost or stolen. It can also aid the maintenance, disposal of equipment and ensure 
that confidential information and licensed software is properly removed from all devices.  
 
 
5 Breaches of Policy  
Breaches of this policy and/or security incidents can be defined as events which could have, or have 
resulted in, loss or damage to MyTutor assets, or an event which is in breach of MyTutor ’s security 
procedures and policies. 
All employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors have a responsibility to report security 
incidents and breaches of this policy as quickly as possible through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting 
Procedure. This obligation also extends to any external organisation contracted to support or access 
the Information Systems of MyTutor. 
 
In the case of third-party vendors, consultants or contractor’s non-compliance could result in the 
immediate removal of access to the system. If damage or compromise of MyTutor’s ICT systems or 
network results from the non-compliance, MyTutorwill consider legal action against the third party. 
MyTutor will take appropriate measures to remedy any breach of the policy through the relevant
