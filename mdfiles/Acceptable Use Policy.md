1. Overview 
MyTutor provides many essential services and business functions which rely on ICT technology 
resources. The use of ICT resources must be in line with good professional working practices, 
procedures and must ensure the security and integrity of all MyTutor information and data. 
2. Policy Statement 
2.1.1. Computer Use 
 
All users of MyTutor’s computers must ensure at all times that: 
•  Authorisation has been provided to use the ICT facilities with a Domain username and 
password provided by the IT Department. 
•  User and System account logon passwords are kept private and not shared, displayed or 
communicated to anyone who does not have a legitimate right to that information. 
•  MyTutor’s information and data is not permanently saved to PC hard drives – in the event of 
MyTutor’s network being unavailable, advice should be sought from the IT Department. 
•  Sensitive and personal data is not knowingly saved on the PC's hard drive under any 
circumstances. 
•  Data and Information saved to portable devices via a PC is only copied to MyTutor approved 
portable device which is encrypted in accordance with the Encryption Policy. 
 
N.B - Mobile computing devices such as digital cameras and digital dictation devices etc., must not 
be treated as data storage devices – however, MyTutor accepts that photographs/audio files can 
also be classed as data and recommends that any photographs/audio files taken are removed from 
the device(s) and stored on MyTutor network as soon as possible. 
•  Screens/computers are locked by users when away from the computer. 
•  MyTutor computer equipment, such as desktops, (with the exception of laptop and CTO 
authorised for use) are not removed from their location without line management and/or 
approval from the IT Department. 
•  Unauthorised, non-standard equipment is not plugged-in or inserted into the computer. 
•  Software is not installed on MyTutor’s IT computer equipment by unauthorised staff 
(authorised access may include specific duties requiring staff to have administrative access 
in order to carry out certain job functions) – any software installed must be (or going 
through the process of being) placed on the approved software list. 
     
 
•  MyTutor’s ICT equipment must not be used to store Personal data such as wedding photos, 
CV’s, music files etc. 
•  Computers are not mishandled, wilfully damaged or tampered with in any way – this 
includes taking off the PC/laptop case cover, or removing of any screws or fixings. 
•  Any suspiCTOus or unknown equipment near or around PC's/laptops is reported to the IT 
Department. 
•  Computers are logged off and shut down when not in use for extended periods (i.e. 
overnight) and monitors are powered off.   
 
2.1.2.  Internet and Email Use 
 
2.1.2.1.  Internet 
 
•  Personal use of the Internet is allowed but not during working hours. You can use the 
Internet before you start work, during your lunchtime, or after work. 
•  You must not use MyTutor's Internet or email systems for trading or personal business 
purposes. 
•  If you use the Internet to buy goods or services, MyTutor will not accept liability for default 
of payment or for security of any personal information you provide. 
•  Goods must not be delivered to a MyTutor’s address. 
•  Downloading of video, music files, games, software files and other computer programs - for 
non-work related purposes - is strictly prohibited. These types of files consume large 
quantities of storage space on the system (and can slow it down considerably) and may 
violate copyright laws. 
Many Internet sites that contain unacceptable content are blocked automatically by MyTutor's 
systems. However, it is not possible to block all "unacceptable" sites electronically. You must not 
therefore deliberately view, copy or circulate any material that:  
 
•  Is sexually explicit or obscene. 
•  Is racist, sexist, homophobic, harassing or in any other way discriminatory or offensive.  
•  Contains material the possession of which would constitute a criminal offence. 
•  Promotes any form of criminal activity.  
•  Contains images, cartoons or jokes that will cause offence. 
 
     
 
MyTutor records the details of all Internet traffic. This is to protect MyTutor and its employee’s from 
security breaches, including hacking, and to ensure that ‘unacceptable’ sites are not being visited. 
 
2.1.2.2.  Email 
 
Where possible, personal use of email should be in your own time; limited personal use of email 
during the working day is allowed, but should be restricted to a total of no more than a few minutes 
to respond to urgent incoming personal email.  
Personal use must not, in any way, distract staff from the effective performance of their duties. 
Excessive use is not allowed and may result in disciplinary action including loss of your Internet and 
email access. 
 
You must not use the email system in any way that is insulting or offensive. You must not 
deliberately view, copy or circulate any material that:  
 
•  Is a sexually explicit or obscene 
•  Is racist, sexist, homophobic, harassing or in any other way discriminatory or offensive 
•  Contains material the possession of which would constitute a criminal offence  
•  Promotes any form of criminal activity  
•  Contains unwelcome propositions  
•  Contains images, cartoons or jokes that will cause offence  
•  Appears to be a chain letter 
 
MyTutor routinely produces monitoring information which summarises email use and may lead to 
further investigation being undertaken. 
 
2.1.2.3.   Security 
 
MyTutor’s computer systems are under continuous threat from hackers, virus/malware infections, 
data and equipment theft. MyTutor must remain vigilant at all times in order to safeguard 
information and data and to protect the security and integrity of all ICT systems.  
 
 
     
 
Users of all MyTutor’s computers and devices must ensure that:

•  Computers/devices are not left discarded or unattended in public places. 
•  All portable mobile computing devices and other IT equipment should not be left 
unattended in any vehicle at any time. 
•  Computers/devices must be adequately protected from physical damage.

Department. 
•  All Computers/devices which are no longer required or which have reached the end of useful 
life must be returned via the line manager to the IT Department to be disposed of in accordance 
with Disposal of ICT Equipment.

identified/detected threats from viruses/malware should be reported to the IT Department 
immediately. 
2.1.2.5.  Personal Devices 
 
Personal devices which are not the property of MyTutor, including mobile phones, PDAs, digital pens 
etc., must not be used to record or capture information relating to MyTutor and its services. 
 
2.1.2.6.  Breaches of policy

resulted in, loss or damage to MyTutor’s assets, or an event which is in breach of MyTutor’s security
