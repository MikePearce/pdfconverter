1 Overview 
MyTutor recognises that laptops, tablets, PDAs and other mobile computing devices are 
useful tools which enable more convenient, flexible mobile working across MyTutor network 
however; mobile computing devices must be controlled, configured and used in the most 
secure way possible using standards and procedures to prevent damage to assets and 
reputation of MyTutor. 
2 Scope 
This scope of this policy extends to all departments, employees, contractors, vendors and 
partner agencies who utilise or who are responsible for the development, 
management/maintenance of information within MyTutor’s ICT processing facilities. 
 
3 Purpose 
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that laptops, tablets and other mobile computing devices 
are used, configured and managed in a secure and safe way and to identify and describe the steps 
required to achieve and maintain this 
 
 
4  Policy Statement 
4.1  Laptop and Tablet Devices 
 
All laptop and tablet computers owned by MyTutor are supplied to users with a preconfigured 
standard Windows Operating System image which the IT Service has developed and approved. This 
preconfigured image may vary slightly due to differing departmental requirements and needs, 
however, in terms of security; all laptop and tablet devices connected to MyTutor’s network domain 
will all have the same level of security applied across all areas. 
 
All MyTutor’s laptops/tablets are subject to the following configuration which ensures they are 
added to MyTutor’s network and have the correct security configuration settings applied: 
 
Currently, new laptops/tablets arriving at MyTutor will already have the approved “standard” build 
applied. The configuration of the laptop/tablet image involves the installation of additional software 
(which will vary between departments) and some changes which may be necessary for optimisation 
of the operating system.  
     
  MyTutor Internal MyTutor     
10320 MyTutor  Laptop & Mobile Device Security Procedure  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
 
Currently, newly commissioned laptops/tablets are added to MyTutor Domain using an asset tag 
number as required or Identifier. 
 
N.B. It is planned that these prefixes will not be necessary and may be dropped in the future. 
 
Laptops/tablets can only be added to the Domain and configured with a computer account, by IT 
Service staff that are authorised and have sufficient access permissions to do so. Authorised staff are 
required to logon “locally” to the laptop/tablet using the built-in Administrator’s account in order to 
add the laptop/tablet to the Domain. During the process of adding the computer to the Domain, 
authorised staff are required to provide a valid MyTutor account username and password to 
complete the process. 
Laptops/tablets which have not been added to MyTutor’s network Domain are not able to 
participate in MyTutor’s network and will not be able to authenticate and service user logons – 
irrespective of the level of access the user may have with their Domain account while attempting to 
logon. 
Laptops/tablets are protected from viruses and spyware/malware using MyTutor’s Build standard, 
an industry standard antivirus/malware software product which is automatically installed on all 
laptops/tablets during boot up and is regularly updated with the latest virus/malware definition files. 
 
Laptops/tablets which are for use in partner agency areas are subject to the same security 
restrictions enforced by MyTutor’s network domain. Any network accounts used to access these 
laptops/tablets are managed and authorised by the IT Service. 
 
N.B. Laptops/tablets which have not been provided by MyTutor but have been approved for use will 
be subject to the relevant security checks and procedures by the IT Service. 
As standard  "auto-run" or "auto-play" is disabled on all  systems. 
4.2    Other Mobile Computing Devices 
 
The software in use across MyTutor, both legacy and newer systems have been evaluated, 
purchased and installed on the basis of minimum specification requirements which, for the most 
part, involves running software which is supported by the vendors/contractors. 
 
Other mobile computing devices which do not satisfy the hardware and/or minimum software 
(Operating System) installation specification should not be used to run MyTutor applications nor 
should any attempts be made to use or bypass application/system authentication processes or 
controls when using such devices.

10320 MyTutor  Laptop & Mobile Device Security Procedure  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
 
Other mobile computing devices (i.e. not a laptop or tablet) used for MyTutor’s business should 
primarily be used as a “resource” tool – providing and acting as an enabler to access information 
from MyTutor’s website, intranet and other web-based information and resource sites. 
 
Connecting any mobile computing device to MyTutor’s network must be evaluated by the IT Service 
and subject to existing configuration standards and procedures of MyTutor. The IT Service must be 
contacted for the approval or configuration of any of these devices whether the connection is to be 
made wirelessly or wired. 
 
4.3    Use 
 
MyTutor’s laptops, tablets and other mobile computing devices may only be used by authorised 
parties for authorised MyTutor business or purposes in accordance with MyTutor’s Acceptable Use 
Policy and associated security policies. MyTutor’s employees, partner agencies, contractors and 
vendors must be mindful of the potential for unauthorised access and viewing of MyTutor’s data and 
Information and take appropriate steps to avoid or prevent this. 
 
All users of MyTutor’s laptop, tablet and other mobile computing devices must ensure at all times 
that: 
 
Account logon and system passwords are kept private and not shared, displayed or communicated 
to anyone else. 
Sensitive and personal data must not be saved on any mobile computing device under any 
circumstances. 
Data which is not sensitive or person identifiable may be stored to mobile computing devices only 
when MyTutor Corporate network is unavailable - data should then be transferred to the Corporate 
network once it becomes available again and local copies of data should be deleted.  
Users must be made aware that data stored locally on CTO will not be backed up and is at risk from 
being lost. 
Mobile computing devices must not be treated as data storage devices – only portable media which 
has been encrypted and agreed for use in accordance with MyTutor’s Encryption Policy may be used 
to store MyTutor’s data. 
Data and Information which is accessed or saved to portable storage devices (e.g. USB data stick - 
not on the mobile computing device itself) via a laptop, tablet or other mobile computing device 
must only be copied to a storage device which is encrypted in accordance with MyTutor’s Encryption 
Policy.

Screens on mobile computing devices must be locked by users when away from the device or if left 
unattended. 
Unauthorised, non-standard or personal equipment must not be plugged-in or inserted into the 
mobile computing device. 
Software must not be installed on the laptop, tablet or mobile device by unauthorised staff. 
Any software installed must be (or going through the process of being) placed on the approved 
software list. 
Mobile computing devices must not be mishandled, wilfully damaged or tampered with in any way – 
this includes taking off the device case cover (other than for the replacement of batteries or 
extended memory card/s) or removing of any screws or fixings. 
Mobile computing devices are logged off and shut down when not in use for extended periods and 
are powered off. 
Any mobile computing device is not given to any unauthorised persons for safe keeping. 
Any mobile computing device is not left discarded or unattended in a public place. 
All reasonable steps are taken to ensure that during transit, any mobile computing device is locked 
via a key or combination lock and securely located. Portable mobile computing devices must not be 
left unattended in any vehicle at any time due to insurance requirements. 
Any mobile computing device must be adequately protected from physical damage. 
Any mobile computing device is not hired, lent out or given without authorisation from the IT 
Service. 
Any mobile computing device which is no longer required or has reached the end of its useful life 
must be returned via the line manager to the IT Department to be disposed of through MyTutor’s 
ICT disposal procedure. 
All mobile computing devices must be handed back to the IT Department via the line manager on 
cessation of employment with MyTutor or when no longer required as part of an individual’s current 
employment. 
All CTO must be made available when requested by the IT Service/authorised officers for 
maintenance and policy compliance reviews. 
Care is taken when using remote connections including wireless network points that these are 
“trusted” and adequately secured – further guidance is available in the Wireless Access Policy. 
N.B. Loss of any mobile computing device must be reported immediately to the IT Service, Service 
Desk 
 
4.4    Maintenance 
 
All maintenance of mobile computing devices is carried out by IT Service authorised staff. 
     
  MyTutor Internal MyTutor     
10320 MyTutor  Laptop & Mobile Device Security Procedure  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
Only staff working within an ICT function (or persons authorised by the IT Service) may perform 
maintenance, install applications/software or make system configuration changes to mobile 
computing devices. Staff may occasionally be requested to assist while under the supervision and 
authorisation of the IT Service as appropriate. 
A standard base configuration is installed on all MyTutor’s laptop and tablet devices. Any variations 
and additions must be agreed by the IT Service and the Security/Business Continuity Manager must 
be notified. 
Laptops/tablets are protected against malicious code in accordance with MyTutor’s malicious 
software and anti-virus Procedure. 
All mobile computing devices are maintained in accordance with all relevant policies and procedures 
of MyTutor.  
All operating system software and firmware must be receiving regular security updates from the 
supplier. 
Windows and Mac devices are set to update automatically. 
 
4.5    Disposal 
 
All mobile computing devices which are scheduled for replacement will be disposed of by the IT 
Service through MyTutor’s ICT disposal procedures. 
 
Without exception, any computer or device which is used for the handling or creation of MyTutor’s 
data must be secured and is subject to all the relevant policies and procedures specific to the 
security of ICT equipment and its use. 
 
 
5 Breaches of Policy  
Breaches of this policy and/or security incidents can be defined as events which could have, or have 
resulted in, loss or damage to  MyTutor assets, or an event which is in breach of MyTutor’s security 
procedures and policies. 
All employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors have a responsibility to report security 
incidents and breaches of this policy as quickly as possible through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting 
Procedure. This obligation also extends to any external organisation contracted to support or access 
the Information Systems of MyTutor. 
In the case of third party vendors, consultants or contractors non-compliance could result in the 
immediate removal of access to the system. If damage or compromise of MyTutor’s ICT systems or 
network results from the non-compliance, MyTutor will consider legal action against the third party.
