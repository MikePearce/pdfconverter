1 Overview 
Availability, confidentiality and integrity are fundamental aspects of the protection of systems and 
information and are achieved through physical, logical and procedural controls. It is vital for the 
protection of systems and information authorised users who have access to MyTutor’s systems and 
information are aware of and understand how their actions may affect security. 
 
Availability – systems and information are physically secure and will be accessible to authorised 
persons when required. 
 
Confidentiality – systems and information will only be accessible to authorised persons. 
 
Integrity – the accuracy and completeness of systems and information are safeguarded. 
 
Authorised users referred to in this document are members of the following groups:- 
 
All parties (Either as part of a contract of employment or third party contract) who have access to, or 
use of ICT systems and information belonging to, or under the control of MyTutor including: 
  MyTutor employees 
  Contractors 
  Full and part-time staff 
  Temporary staff 
  Agency staff 
  Partner organisations 
  Any other party utilising MyTutor’s ICT resources 
2 Scope 
The scope of this policy extends to all departments, employees, contractors, vendors and partner 
agencies who use/access MyTutor’s ICT facilities. 
   This policy applies to: 
  All of MyTutor’s departments, personnel and systems (including software) dealing with the 
storing, retrieval and accessing of data. 
3 Purpose 
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that both logical and physical access to information and 
systems is controlled and procedures are in place to ensure the protection of information systems 
and data. 
4 Policy Statement 
On-going education featuring corporate induction programmes, eLearning, line manager training, 
specific training and awareness programmes must be undertaken by staff to enable them to be 
aware of their responsibilities towards systems and information security. 
     
10050  MyTutor-Access Control Policy  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
 
4.1  Systems/Information Access 
 
The Access Control matrix system is for managers to complete if an employee’s role within the 
organisation changes and access to systems needs to be updated or removed. Managers must 
contact MyTutor system owners to ensure access to other systems and programs are updated if a 
user’s role or business needs change. 
 
  For systems containing restricted and personal information and data, an access control 
matrix must be developed to record role based authorised access recorded on an individual 
basis. Authorisation procedures must be in place for managers to authorise all access 
(including short term and temporary access) recorded on the matrix. The access matrix must 
be continually updated and maintained to reflect accurate records of access. 
  To gain access to specific systems and information, a member of staff will need to follow a 
formal application process. Users will need to apply to the relevant owners/senior custodian 
of the systems using the appropriate completed forms. 
  Generic  logons  are  not  generally  permitted  across  MyTutor  however,  use  of  generic 
accounts under exceptional ‘controlled’ circumstances is permitted, and for members of the 
Dev/Ops team. 
  To  ensure  relevant  MyTutor  or  national  legislation  security  standards  are  adhered  to, 
personnel checks, such as DBS and Baseline Personnel Security Standard checks may be 
undertaken if required. 
  The appropriate level of access to systems and information will be determined upon the 
prospective users required business need, job function and role. 
  A signed confirmation by the user may be required indicating that they understand and 
appreciate the conditions of access and security. 
  If authorisation to use systems and information is granted, unique logon credentials and 
password will be provided to the applicant. Further instruction on how to maintain the 
security of systems and information with due regard to the procedures below may be given. 
  Access for remote users shall be subject to authorisation by line managers via the IT 
Department. No uncontrolled external access shall be permitted to any network device or 
networked system. 
  The application and all other documentation should be maintained in line with all relevant 
guidance. 
  Where staff members use their own personal devices, which require them to enter their 
personal credentials. All company devices require unique credentials 
  A list of all administrative and user accounts within the organisation is aligned with the 
information asset register and regularly reviewed for privilege needs and requirements. 
  Where 2FA is built-in natively and does not require any additional software or hardware it 
should be used. 
 
 
4.2  Systems/Information Deregistration 
 
     
10050  MyTutor-Access Control Policy  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
  If a member of staff changes role or their contract is terminated, their manager should apply 
to  have  the  users  access  to  the system/information  reviewed  or  removed  as  soon  as 
possible. 
  If a member of staff is deemed to have contravened any of the Information Security policies 
or procedures, potentially jeopardising the availability, confidentiality or integrity of any 
systems or information, their access rights to the system/information should be reviewed by 
the system owners. 
  If a specific access limit is exceeded or control circumvented several times by a user the 
manager should review the access rights of the user and if necessary remind the user of the 
relevant access and security. 
  If a number of unsuccessful log-on attempts are exceeded, the user will be informed that 
they need to contact the system owners or the IT Department to ask for access rights to be 
re-established. In these circumstances, access rights may need to be reviewed. 
  If it is deemed that it is no longer appropriate or necessary for a user to have access to 
systems and/or information then the user’s manager will need to inform the owners of the 
system/information that access rights should be altered/removed immediately. 
  If any system/information rights are altered or removed, the relevant documentation will 
need to be updated accordingly. 
  All user accounts on systems are reviewed  and checked if they are needed at least quarterly 
. 
  As part  of  deregistration  the  procedure  is  to  delete  all  accounts  associated  with  that 
employee. 
 
 
4.3  Logon Considerations 
 
  All systems should be accessed by secure authentication of user validation. As a minimum 
this should entail use of a User name and a Password. 
  Logon to systems/information should only be attempted using authorised and correctly 
configured equipment in accordance with MyTutor’s policies. 
  After successful logon users should ensure that equipment is not left unattended and active 
sessions are terminated or locked as necessary. Systems should be logged off, closed down 
or terminated as soon as possible. 
  System logon data should not be copied, shared or written down. 
 
4.4  Physical Access and Controls 
 
Maintaining the physical security of offices and rooms where information, data and processing 
facilities are accessed and located is vitally important. There must be methods of physically securing 
access to protect information and data: 
 
  Staff, as needed, wears their MyTutor’s ID badges and visitors must wear the Visitor ID 
badges which have been issued to them. People who are not displaying ID badges should be 
challenged. Any person not known to location personnel must be challenged in order to 
establish who they are and whether authorisation has been provided for them to be there. If 
     
10050  MyTutor-Access Control Policy  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
there  is  any  doubt  about  the  identity  of  the  individual,  the  appropriate  security 
officer/manager should be contacted to confirm the individual’s identity. 
  Appropriate recording mechanisms need to be in place to record the names, dates, times 
and  signatures  for  the  signing  in  and  out  of  visitors  (including  MyTutor  personnel)  to 
MyTutor’s locations. All visitors must be issued with an authorised MyTutor visitors badge 
when signing in. 
  The use of keys to buildings, rooms, secure cabinets, safes etc. must be controlled and 
recorded. Keys must be stored in secure areas/locked cabinets when not in use and must be 
identifiable by recording serial/ID markings of all keys. The location of keys must be known 
at all times and a signing in/out recording mechanism must be maintained to record the 
serial/ID of keys against individual names when keys are used. 
  Electronic access fobs must be issued to authorised staff on an individual basis. Staff issued 
with access fobs must have their names and employee numbers recorded against the 
registered access fob number including date and time of issue. 
  Access fobs should only be used by the registered user and must not be lent out or given to 
other staff, regardless of their seniority. In emergency situations, authorised personnel may 
be permitted to use another authorised person’s fob if available with permission of the line 
manager and the recorded user must either be present or be made aware that their fob is 
being used. Any such use must be recorded and maintained in a logging system for this type 
of event. 
  Access fobs issued to personnel who no longer work for MyTutor must be deactivated and 
recovered immediately – a record of this action must be kept, using an official recording 
system. 
  Locations housing critical or sensitive information and/or information processing facilities 
should have a secure, physically sound perimeter with suitable controls and restrictions 
allowing access to authorised staff only. CCTV and audible alarm systems should be active in 
areas where critical servers are located, such as in the data centre. 
  Observance and maintenance of the physical security of rooms and offices where PC's 
and/or  critical  information  processing  equipment  is  located  needs  to  be  a  paramount 
consideration. For example, do not house critical equipment in publicly accessible locations, 
close to windows, in areas where theft is a high risk. Locate servers and business critical 
equipment in locations with adequate environmental and fire controls. 
  Access to  information  processing  systems will only  be  allocated  to  staff  following  any 
required legal/MyTutor checks. If required, usage policies will also need to be signed by 
staff. 
  All interfaces used for managing system administration and enabling access to information 
processing must be appropriately secured. 
  Access to and knowledge of key fobs, door lock codes or access to keys for locks, are 
restricted to authorised personnel only and must not be shared with any unauthorised 
person. 
  Access codes used for secure locking mechanisms must be changed on a regular basis as 
specified by the location manager in line with professional best practice. 
  If electronic door locks/key fobs are in use they must be issued to authorised staff on an 
individual basis, be fully registered to that individual and only used by that individual. The 
key fob must be deactivated immediately when no longer required and registration details 
updated accordingly. 
  Direct access to secure locations, or access to adjoining offices which could provide access, 
must be locked and secured using appropriate locking mechanisms. 
     
10050  MyTutor-Access Control Policy  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
  All MyTutor/Contracted Cleaners must have and display appropriate identification and be 
made aware of the requirements within this procedure. 
  Personal, special access visits from relatives or acquaintances of personnel are not permitted 
within secure areas. There must be a valid reason for all visits and any such visitors must go 
through the standard signing in/out procedure. 
  Equipment should be sited to minimise unnecessary, unauthorised access into work areas. 
For example, refreshment units or office machinery designed for visitors should be placed in 
public accessible areas only. 
 
 
5 Responsibilities 
Directors are responsible for ensuring that all staff and managers are aware of security policies and 
that they are observed. Managers need to be aware they have a responsibility to ensure that staff 
holds sufficient, relevant knowledge concerning the security of information and systems. Designated 
owners of systems, who have responsibility for the management of ICT systems and inherent 
information, need to ensure that all staff has been made aware of their responsibilities toward 
security. Designated owners of systems and information need to ensure they uphold the security 
policies and procedures. 
 
 
6 Breaches of Policy  
Breaches of this policy and/or security incidents can be defined as events which could have, or have 
resulted in, loss or damage to MyTutor’s assets, or an event which is in breach of MyTutor’s security 
procedures and policies. 
All MyTutor employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors have a responsibility to report 
security incidents and breaches of this policy as quickly as possible through IS30 Incident Reporting 
and Management Procedure. This obligation also extends to any external organisation contracted to 
support or access the Information Systems of MyTutor. 
MyTutor will take appropriate measures to remedy any breach of the policy and its associated 
procedures and guidelines through the relevant frameworks in place.  In the case of an individual 
then the matter may be dealt with under the disciplinary process.
