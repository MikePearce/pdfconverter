10030  MyTutor  -Third Party Connection Policy  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
1 Overview 
MyTutor  permits  connections  to  Third  Party  organisations  to  promote  partnership  working, 
information sharing, service provision and support arrangements with Third Party organisations or 
service providers. This policy is specific to MyTutor’s requirements when establishing new links 
between MyTutor and Third Party organisations and makes reference to MyTutor’s additional 
security policies and procedures. 
 
2 Scope 
Third parties are defined as any individual or organisation not employed directly by MyTutor. It also 
includes suppliers who require access to MyTutor’s network to provide remote support. 
 
This policy applies to all existing and new permanent or temporary connections and applies to any 
connection agreement with a third party. Any sanctions and obligations specified within the contract 
may be imposed as part of the third party connection agreement. 
 
3 Purpose 
The purpose of this policy is to clarify the procedures and responsibilities with regard to initiating a 
new connection between MyTutor and a Third Party organisation or service provider in order to 
maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
4 Policy Statement 
The overall security of MyTutor’s infrastructure, systems and data takes precedence over any 
individual requirements for a Third Party connection.  
 
A specific business purpose must exist and be defined for a Third Party connection to be considered. 
For each Third Party connection agreement, named lead persons responsible for the system and 
information concerned must be appointed by both MyTutorand the Third Party.  
 
A risk assessment should be conducted, prior to implementation of any connection, to identify 
specific requirements. It will be the responsibility of MyTutor’s named lead person to carry out the 
assessment. The risk assessment will consider:  
 
•  A description of the participants in the assessment. 
•  The type of access required and the data that needs to be available to the Third Party. 
•  The value and sensitivity of information and information systems that may be exposed to 
unauthorised access 
•  The threat and vulnerability (the risk) to information and information systems and the 
impact if the threat were to take place 
     
10030  MyTutor  -Third Party Connection Policy  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
•  The controls required to protect information and information systems. An overview of the 
users 
•  How the Third Party organisation manages and controls information security 
•  Details of how the Third Party will secure their ICT equipment and networks 
•  The method of access required – physical and logical connectivity between information 
systems.  
•  Dates of when the access is required from and a cessation date if a temporary arrangement. 
If a permanent arrangement is required, then an annual review must be incorporated in the 
agreement. 
•  Security incident management 
•  Legal requirements affecting stakeholders 
•  A statement assessing and listing all risks. 
•  An overall conclusion 
 
Any Third Party Organisation with which MyTutor enters into a connection agreement must be able 
to demonstrate compliance with MyTutor’s information security policies and enter into binding 
agreements that specify the performance to be delivered and the remedies available in the event of 
non-compliance. 
 
MyTutor’s point of contact will: 
 
•  Have administrative responsibilities 
•  Approve a non-disclosure agreement in conjunction with Legal Services for any/or named 
individuals accessing the services/information provided by the connection. 
•  Be responsible for remote access provision 
•  Act as a point of liaison both with the Third Party and IT Service 
•  Be responsible for ensuring background checks (such as DBS and Baseline Personnel Security 
Standard) are made on individuals utilising services/information provided by the connection 
•  Ensure all relevant bodies are informed when the connection is no longer required  
 
The Third Party point of contact will: 
 
•  Be responsible for managing all aspects of the connection on behalf of the Third Party. 
•  Be the primary point of contact and be able to provide accurate information on all aspects of 
the Third Party. 
•  Ensure that all Third Party users have received appropriate training and have under-gone 
appropriate background checks. 
 
Third Party access to MyTutor’s network potentially exposes MyTutor’s infrastructure to risk and 
therefore there must be an agreement in place that assures MyTutor that any third party connection 
meets the security standards. The Third Party must consider and address:-  
 
•  A description of services and service level agreement. 
•  Reference to relevant MyTutor security policies and legislation. 
•  Requirements for asset protection and access control. 
•  Responsibilities and liabilities. 
•  Monitoring rights and reporting processes. 
•  Conditions for termination and renegotiation of agreements. 
 
     
10030  MyTutor  -Third Party Connection Policy  2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
If a log of third party activity on MyTutor’s network is required as part of the agreement, then the 
third party will need to retain this log for the period specified in the agreement. Remote access 
software must be disabled when not in use. 
 
All Third Party access must be facilitated through a method of connection approved by MyTutor 
which provides protection to the satisfaction of the company. All Third Party access must be logged 
via the IT Department and duly authorised before being permitted onto MyTutor’s network. Once 
authorisation has been obtained a time restrictive user name and password should be provided. 
 
Changes to methods of connection must be clearly defined and agreed by MyTutor and the Third 
Party. 
 
Third Parties and MyTutor must inform each other about any security incidents which may impact 
on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the third party service or data provided by the 
service. Incidents originating within MyTutor must be handled in accordance with the ‘Security 
incident management policy and procedures’. The range of security incidents which will require 
security awareness procedures include: 
 
•  Computers left unlocked when unattended 
•  Password disclosures 
•  Virus warnings/alerts 
•  Media loss 
•  Data loss/disclosure 
•  Misuse/loss/corruption/alteration of Personal information  
•  Physical security 
•  Missing correspondence 
•  Found correspondence/media 
•  Loss or theft of IT/information 
•  Misuse of IT equipment/facilities 
 
Third Parties with whom MyTutor has a Third Party connection contract are permitted access only to 
systems and information related to that contract. All other access is prohibited. Any Third Party with 
access to sensitive MyTutor information must be cleared to the same security and human resources 
checks as MyTutor’s staff. 
 
5 Responsibilities 
It is the responsibility of MyTutor and each Third Party to ensure that all sections of this policy are

become apparent, such as:-

  Changes in the information required

8 Breaches of Policy  
Breaches of this policy and/or security incidents can be defined as events which could have, or have 
resulted in, loss or damage to  MyTutor’s assets, or an event which is in breach of MyTutor’s security 
procedures and policies. 
MyTutor will take appropriate measures to remedy any breach of a third party connection 
agreement. If a breach/security incident relates to a Third Party, MyTutor reserves the right to 
immediately terminate the Third Party connection and, subject to the nature of the breach/security 
incident, seek compensation or take legal action. If it can be determined that the breach/security 
incident has been caused by an employee of the third party, MyTutor would retain the right to 
request the employer to remove their employee from their premises. 
If the breach/security incident is determined to have been caused by an individual employed by 
MyTutor, the matter may be dealt with under the disciplinary process.
