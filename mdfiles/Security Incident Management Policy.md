1 Overview 
MyTutor is responsible for the security and integrity of all data it holds. MyTutor must protect this 
data using all means necessary by ensuring at all times that any incident which could cause damage 
to MyTutor’s assets and reputation is prevented and/or minimised. There are many types of 
incidents which could affect security: 
 
•  A computer security incident is an event affecting adversely the processing of computer 
usage. This includes: 
•  Loss of confidentiality of information 
•  Compromise of integrity of information 
•  Denial of service 
•  Unauthorized access to systems 
•  Misuse of systems or information 
•  Theft and damage to systems 
•  Virus attacks 
•  Intrusion by humans 
 
Other incidents include: 
•  Loss of ID badge/s 
•  Missing correspondence 
•  Exposure of Uncollected print-outs 
•  Misplaced or missing media 
•  Inadvertently relaying passwords 
 
Ensuring efficient reporting and management of security incidents will help reduce and in many 
cases, prevent incidents occurring.  
More detailed information on the type and scope of security incidents is provided in the Policy 
Statement section of this policy.  
2  Scope 
The scope of this policy extends to all departments, employees, contractors, vendors and partner 
agencies who use/access MyTutor’s ICT facilities. 
  This policy applies to: 
  All of MyTutor’s departments, personnel and systems (including software) dealing with the 
storing, retrieval and accessing of data. 
     
10070  MyTutor-Security Incident Management Policy   2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
3 Purpose 
The purpose of this Acceptable Policy is to apply acceptable use controls to Information, Information 
Systems, software Applications, Communication Networks, and CTO, used throughout. 
4 Policy Statement 
MyTutor has a clear incident reporting mechanism in place which details the procedures for the 
identifying, reporting and recording of security incidents. By continually updating and informing 
MyTutor’s employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors of the importance of the 
identification, reporting and action required addressing incidents; MyTutor can continue to be pro-
active in addressing these incidents as and when they occur. 
 
All MyTutor employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors are required to report all 
incidents – including potential or suspected incidents, as soon as possible via MyTutor’s Incident 
Reporting procedures. 
The types of Incidents which this policy addresses include but is not limited to: 
 
4.1  Computers left unlocked when unattended 
 
Users of MyTutor’s computer systems are continually reminded of the importance of locking their 
computers when not in use or when leaving computers unattended for any length of time. All 
MyTutor’s employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors need to ensure they lock their 
computers appropriately - this must be done despite the fact that MyTutor computers are 
configured to automatically lock after 5 minutes of idle time. 
Discovery of an unlocked computer which is unattended must be reported via MyTutor’s Incident 
Reporting procedures. 
 
4.2  Password disclosures 
 
Unique IDs and account passwords are used to allow an individual access to systems and data. It is 
imperative that individual passwords are not disclosed to others – regardless of trust. If an individual 
needs access to data or a system, they must go through the correct procedures for authorisation – 
initially through the individual’s line manager. If anyone suspects that their or any other user’s 
password has been disclosed whether intentionally, inadvertently or accidentally, the IT Service 
must be notified through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting procedures. For more information, 
MyTutor’s Password policy is available on the intranet or via the IT Department’s Service Desk. 
     
10070  MyTutor-Security Incident Management Policy   2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
Under no circumstances should an employee allow another employee to use their user account 
details after they have logged onto a system – even under supervision. 
 
4.3  Virus warnings/alerts 
 
All Desktop, laptop and tablet computers in use across MyTutor have Antivirus (including Anti-
Spyware/Malware). For the most part, the interaction between the computer and antivirus software 
will go unnoticed by users of the computer. On occasion, an antivirus warning message may appear 
on the computer screen. The message may indicate that a virus has been detected which could 
cause loss, theft or damage to MyTutor’s data. The warning message may indicate that the antivirus 
software may not be able to rectify the problem and so must be reported by the user to the IT 
Department as soon as possible. 
 
4.4  Media loss 
 
Use of portable media such as CD/DVD, DAT (magnetic tape), USB Flash sticks/HD drives for storing 
data requires the user to be fully aware of the responsibilities of using such devices. The use of PC's, 
laptops, tablets and many other portable devices increases the potential for data to be exposed and 
vulnerable to unauthorised access. Any authorised user of a portable device who has misplaced or 
suspects damage, theft whether intentional or accidental of any portable media must report it 
immediately through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting procedures. 
 
4.5  ID Badges 
 
It is essential for us to identify individuals and wearing ID badges wear necessary helps us to do this.  
 
4.6  Data loss/disclosure 
 
The potential for data loss does not only apply to portable media it also applies to any data which is: 
 
•  Transmitted over a network and reaching an unintended, unauthorised recipient (such as 
the use of e-mail to send sensitive data) 
•  Intercepted over the internet through non secure channels 
•  Posting of data on the internet whether accidental or intentional 
     
10070  MyTutor-Security Incident Management Policy   2020-08-14.docx MyTutor     www.mytutor.co.uk     
 
•  Published on MyTutor’s website and identified as inaccurate or inappropriate (which must 
be reported) 
•  Conversationally – information disclosed during conversation 
•  Press or media – unauthorised disclosure by employees or an ill-advised representative to 
the press or media 
•  Data which can no longer be located and is unaccounted for on an IT system 
•  Unlocked and uncollected print-outs from Multi-Function Devices (MFD’s) 
•  Paper copies of data and information which can no longer be located 
•  Hard copies of information and data accessible from desks and unattended areas 
 
All of MyTutor’s employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors must act responsibly, 
professionally and be mindful of the importance of maintaining the security and integrity of 
MyTutor’s data at all times. 
Any loss of data and/or disclosure whether intentional or accidental must be reported immediately 
using MyTutor’s Incident Reporting procedures 
 
4.7  Personal information abuse 
 
All person identifiable information – i.e. information which can identify an individual such as home 
address, bank account details etc. must not be disclosed, discussed or passed on to any person/s 
who is not in a position of authority to view, disclose or distribute such information.  
Any abuse/misuse of such person identifiable information must be reported through MyTutor’s 
Incident Reporting procedures. 
 
4.8  Physical Security 
 
Maintaining the physical security of offices and rooms where data is stored, maintained, viewed or 
accessed is of paramount importance. Rooms or offices which have been designated specifically as 
areas where secure information is located or stored must have a method of physically securing 
access to the room – e.g. a combination key lock mechanism. Lower floor/level windows could also 
provide access to the room/office and must also be securely locked – particularly when the room is 
left unattended. Rooms which have not been secured should not be used to store sensitive and 
personal information and data - concerns about any rooms/office which should be securely locked or 
access restricted must be reported to the IT Service via MyTutor’s Incident Reporting procedures. 
 
Continuing emphasis and re-enforcement of MyTutor’s Secure Desk policy will further help to reduce 
the number of security incidents.

4.9  Logical Security / Access Controls 
 
Controlling, managing and restricting access to MyTutor’s Network, Databases and applications is an 
essential part of Information Security.  It is necessary to ensure that only authorized employees can 
gain access to information which is processed and maintained electronically. 
 
4.10  Missing correspondence 
 
Data or information which has been sent either electronically or physically which cannot be 
accounted for e.g. not arrived at the intended destination via physical post, sent electronically, sent 
for printing but no printed output retrieved etc. must be reported through MyTutor’s Incident 
Reporting procedures. 
 
4.11  Found correspondence/media 
 
Data stored on any storage media or physically printed information which has been found in a place 
other than a secure location or a place where the security and integrity of the data/information 
could be compromised by unauthorised viewing and/or access e.g. unlocked printouts, discarded CD 
(media), must be reported through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting procedures. 
 
4.12  Loss or theft of IT/information 
 
Data or information which can no longer be located or accounted for e.g. cannot be found in a 
location where it is expected to be, filing cabinet etc., or which is known/or suspected to have been 
stolen needs to be reported immediately through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting procedures.
