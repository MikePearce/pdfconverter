as desktop, laptop, notebook and tablet PC's are provided for use by those who require 
them to carry out their duties.  All employees have a duty to ensure that appropriate levels 
of security are applied to all PC's used in the office environment. 
 
2 Scope 
This applies to all PC/Laptop and server builds for internal and customer use. 
 
3 Purpose 
The purpose of these procedures is to ensure that PC's in a Business environment are used, 
configured and managed in a secure and safe way and to identify and describe the steps 
required to achieve and maintain this. 
 
 
4  Procedures

the office environment over long periods on a daily basis.

4.2  Configuration 
 
  All MyTutor’s PC's are supplied to users with a preconfigured standard Build Operating 
System image which the IT Department has developed in line with NCSC guidelines.  
  Differing  departmental  requirements  result  in  department  specific  applications  being 
layered on top of the standard image. In terms of security; all computers connected to 
MyTutor’s network domain will all have the same level of security applied across all areas. 
 
  All MyTutor’s Desktop PC's are subject to the following configuration which ensures PC's are
