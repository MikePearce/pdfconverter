1 Overview 
Encryption technologies provide a level of protection for the storage, transmittal, retrieval 
and access to this data. Encryption works by converting data to make it inaccessible and 
unreadable to unauthorised individuals. The only way to read the encrypted data is by using 
a decryption key. 
 
The Data Protection Regulations requires MyTutor to have appropriate policies and 
procedures in place to ensure the safe keeping, use, retrieval and access to data covered by 
the Act MyTutor has a responsibility to ensure the integrity, security and protection of all 
data which it holds. 
 
2 Scope 
This policy covers all electronic data and details the types of devices which are acceptable 
for the storage / transmittal of data, and how these devices utilise encryption software, 
irrespective of whether or not the data held on them is considered sensitive or confidential. 
This policy covers encryption for the following devices and applications: 
 
•  Desktop, laptop, tablet computers. 
•  Handheld devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. 
•  Portable storage devices e.g. USB memory sticks, external drives. 
•  Removable media e.g. floppy disks, DVD’s / CD’s, backup tapes. 
•  Email. 
 
MyTutor’s “Internet and E-mail Acceptable Use Policy” provides more general information 
on the e-mail service and use and is available from MyTutor’s intranet or by request to the IT 
Department’s Service Desk. 
 
 
3 Purpose 
The purpose of this policy is to: 
 
•  Detail the specification and deployment of data encryption software for the protection of 
electronic information held by MyTutor. 
•  Provide guidance on the responsibilities of the use and handling of portable media. 
•  Provide clarity on the types of portable storage and CTO which are allowed for use. 
•  Describe how encryption will be used and applied to devices. 
•  Provide guidance on the responsibilities of the use of encrypted devices. 
•  Detail the method of reporting breaches of this policy whether intentional or accidental.

4  Policy Statement 
4.1  Encryption 
 
1.  Full disk encryption will be rolled out gradually to all computers across MyTutor.  
The encryption software employed for use at MyTutor uses a minimum of AES 256 bit (
  Advanced Encryption Standard) which is a symmetric-key encryption with a 256-bit key. 
 
4.2    Objectives 
 
1.  Full disk encryption ideally linked to the bios to prevent hard disk swapping will be rolled out 
to all computers by the IT Department as part of desktop upgrades. 
 
2.  MyTutor’s data should not be stored on computers or portable media devices unless access 
is required when network connectivity is not available. When it is necessary data should only 
be stored on authorised devices. 
 
3.  Encryption is applied to all authorised data storage devices attached to desktop, laptop or 
tablet computers. In certain cases, it may not be feasible for certain devices to be encrypted 
and each exception to a device will be given full and careful consideration as to its use and 
any decision made will be based on best practice and MyTutor need. 
 
4.  Where exceptions have been identified for not encrypting specific devices, computer policy 
settings  (enforced  at  domain  level)  which  enable/disable  encryption  can  be  applied 
individually to a specified computer and/or groups of computers. 
 
5.  When  a  portable  device,  MyTutor’s  recommended  data  storage  device  is  used,  the 
instructions for the correct use must be followed to ensure the data is encrypted. 
 
6.  Personal storage media and equipment must not be connected to MyTutor’s network and 
must not be used to store MyTutor’s data. 
 
7.  Other portable USB devices include mobile phones, cameras, PDAs etc. These other devices 
should not be used to store MyTutor’s data. You must contact the IT Department if you need 
to use these devices as part of your job. 
 
8.  If clarification is needed as to the recommended USB data storage devices allowed for use, 
the IT Department should be contacted. 
 
9.  The Security Officer will advise on the best method to encrypt individual files.

4.3    Method 
 
On encryption of an authorised portable storage device (e.g. USB data stick) the user will need to set 
a password for accessing the device. The password for encrypted portable devices will be in line with 
MyTutor’s password policy and be enforced at the domain level. Using the portable device on any 
other computer after being encrypted will require a password in order to access it. It is important 
that local procedures are put in place to ensure that passwords used to encrypt devices are 
approved by line managers, so that in the event an individual leaves MyTutor, access can be gained 
to MyTutor’s data. 
 
The use of DVD/CD devices and floppy drives will be restricted to read-only access – this will be 
enforced at the domain level by MyTutor’s Policy. 
 
Where there is a need for a particular job function requiring write access to CD/DVD or floppy drives, 
this can be enabled as an exception and recorded formally with agreement from the IT Department. 
Any agreement to allow write access of CD/DVD or floppy devices will include the conditional use of 
appropriate 3rd party archiving (zip) compression/encryption software to be used to encrypt any 
data stored or written to these devices. This conditional encryption/compression software will be 
made available as recommended by the IT Department. 
 
Any other requirement for portable storage device such as portable hard drives, magnetic/DAT tapes 
and devices must be discussed with the IT Department and only hardware and software on 
MyTutor’s approved software and hardware list is to be used. 
 
Computers requiring encryption for the protection of vulnerable and sensitive data will use 
appropriate encryption prior to subsequent rollout on MyTutor’s network. 
 
 
4.4    Responsibilities 
 
MyTutor has a responsibility to provide its employees with the appropriate secure storage 
mechanisms, procedures devices and software for the secure handling, storage and retrieval of all 
electronic data held by MyTutor. The use of portable devices may be subject to random periodic 
review by MyTutor to ensure compliance with the encryption policy.  
 
All MyTutor’s employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors have a duty to abide by all 
MyTutor’s policies and procedures to ensure the safe, secure handling of all electronic data.

4.5  Use of portable storage media and devices  
 
MyTutor’s employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors undertaking work for MyTutor 
who are issued with portable storage devices, writing to portable storage media, 
viewing/transmitting encrypted data or accessing have a responsibility to ensure: 
 
•  No one other than authorised person/s are aware of the encryption/decryption password 
for the device, media or system. 
•  Any portable device or media is not given to any unauthorised persons for safe keeping. 
•  Any portable device or media is not left discarded or unattended in a public place. 
•  All reasonable steps are taken to ensure that during transit, any portable device/media is 
locked via a key or combination lock and securely located. Portable devices/media must not 
be left unattended in any vehicle at any time due to insurance requirements. 
•  Any portable device or media is adequately protected from physical damage. 
•  Any portable device or media is not hired, lent out or given without authorisation from the 
IT Department. 
•  Any portable device or media which is no longer required or has reached its lifespan must be 
handed over to the IT Department. All data on the device/media must be wiped, destroyed 
and disposed of through MyTutor’s ICT disposal procedure. 
•  The device/media is handed back to the IT Department on cessation of employment with 
MyTutor. 
•  The device/media is handed back to the IT Department when no longer authorised to use 
the device/media. 
•  The loss of any portable device is notified immediately via MyTutor’s Incident Escalation 
procedure on the front page of every document. 
5 Breaches of Policy  
Breaches of this policy and/or security incidents can be defined as events which could have, or have 
resulted in, loss or damage to  MyTutor assets, or an event which is in breach of MyTutor’s security 
procedures and policies. 
All employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors have a responsibility to report security 
incidents and breaches of this policy as quickly as possible through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting 
Procedure. This obligation also extends to any external organisation contracted to support or access 
the Information Systems of MyTutor. 
 
In the case of third party vendors, consultants or contractors non-compliance could result in the 
immediate removal of access to the system. If damage or compromise of MyTutor’s ICT systems or 
     
  MyTutor Internal MyTutor

network results from the non-compliance, MyTutor will consider legal action against the third party. 
MyTutor will take appropriate measures to remedy any breach of the policy through the relevant 
frameworks in place.  In the case of an employee then the matter may be dealt with under 
MyTutor’s disciplinary process.
