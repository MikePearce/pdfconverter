10220   MyTutor Teleworking and Mobile Working Procedures  2020-08-14.docx  
1 Overview 
Teleworking and mobile working is use of Information Communication Technology enabling work on, 
or access to MyTutor’s information, perhaps from locations other than a user’s nominated place of 
work. 
Teleworking is defined as working from a fixed remote location, such as home or a touchdown 
centre. Mobile (remote) working is defined as working in a place that is not an individual’s normal 
work base, which could be a touchdown centre, MyTutor providing guest Wi-Fi hotspots, hotels, 
airports, conferences – anywhere a connection to a public communications network makes access 
via secure portals to MyTutor’s resources possible.  
Webmail is a method of accessing MyTutor’s email from a PC or mobile device which has access to 
the internet via a secure, encrypted web browser session.  
This should be used only with Multi Factor authentication or CASB Cloud Access Security Broker 
system if available. 
Working from home, whilst travelling, at a client’s site or at any other location away from the 
established (physical) office may be attractive and offer benefits. However, opening up MyTutor’s 
information and systems through Teleworking/mobile working also presents security risks. Intruders 
(hackers, electronic eavesdroppers, shoulder surfers, etc.) may be able to access, read and 
potentially modify MyTutor’s information and systems without having to be on site. A Secure VPN 
should be used. 
2 Scope 
The scope of these procedures includes all persons/parties who have access to information and ICT 
systems belonging to or under the control of MyTutor; including: 
 
•  MyTutor’s employees 
•  Contractors 
•  Temporary staff 
•  Partner organisations 
•  Any other party utilising MyTutor’s ICT resources 
 
The following four types of flexible worker profiles are included within the scope: flexible worker, 
mobile worker, field worker and fixed home worker.  
 
Processing devices that can be used as part of teleworking or mobile working include:- PC's (Home 
based, touchdown centres etc.), laptops and notebooks, tablet PC's, smart phones, personal digital 
assistants (PDAs), digital cameras, mobile phones and any other mobile device that record and/or 
process information.  
 
Removable media is anything that data can be copied, saved and/or written on to which can then be 
taken away and restored onto another computer (e.g. CD, DVD, flash drives, USB data sticks, 
portable hard drives.)

3 Purpose 
The purpose of these procedures are to ensure that security of information and systems, 
accessed through teleworking and mobile working are given due importance. It is essential that 
staff have the knowledge that security procedures and policies exist and they are understood 
and adhered to. 
 
Information that is related to and can identify an individual is personal data and protected by 
the  principles  of  the  Data  Protection  Regulations.  As  such,  appropriate  technical  and 
organisational  measures  shall  be  taken  against  accidental  or  deliberate  loss,  change, 
destruction of, or damage to personal data. These procedures have been produced to ensure 
that protection of personal data is maintained whilst remote working. 
 
4 Responsibilities 
 
Directors are responsible for ensuring that all staff and managers are aware of security policies 
and that they are observed. Managers need to be aware they have a responsibility to ensure all 
staff has sufficient, relevant knowledge concerning the security of information and systems. 
Designated owners of systems, who have responsibility for the management of ICT systems and 
information, need to ensure that all staff is aware of their responsibilities towards security. 
Designated owners of systems and information need to ensure they uphold the security policies 
and procedures.    
 
Users must have read the rules, regulations and guidelines which advise the correct 
methodology for using Webmail prior to trying to access their MyTutor email using this system. 
5  Procedure Statement 
Access to Office 365 and G suite must follow the latest NCSC guidelines 
 
 
1.  For  teleworking  and  mobile  working,  access  to MyTutor’s  information,  networks  and 
applications (Including MyTutor’s email) can be attained via the secure (Virtual Private 
Network) access portal of MyTutor. This requires two factors of authentication, a computer 
based certificate and User ID/Password. MyTutor’s CTO that have been used to log directly 
on to MyTutor  network at the workplace will have the computer based certificate.  
 
2.  Desk and successful approval from the IT Director, certificates can be installed. 
 
 
3.  It is possible to access MyTutor’s email from a remote location (Such as home) using non-
wireless or wireless technology. 
  
 
     
10220   MyTutor Teleworking and Mobile Working Procedures  2020-08-14.docx  
Staff must ensure when using this service that https is displayed at the start of the address 
line and the padlock symbol is displayed on the browser window.  At the end of using this 
email service staff must logoff MyTutor’s webmail and close the browser window. Failure 
to do so can leave the account accessible to hackers. 
 
4.  Connection to MyTutor’s network should only be attempted using the domain logon and 
password credentials that staff are issued with. Connection using network infrastructure 
that does not belong to MyTutor may enable traffic to be viewed, altered or deleted by an 
attacker. 
 
5.  Extra care should be taken to properly close all applications, network connections and web 
browsers  when  using  PC's,  CTO  and  software  not  officially  provided  by  MyTutor. 
Passwords, logon credentials and sensitive files can be left behind on un-trusted devices, 
making them readily available to subsequent users. 
 
6.  All users accessing MyTutor’s networks or specialised external services via teleworking and 
CTO must abide by associated security policies of MyTutor and any applicable codes of 
connection and conduct.  
 
7.  Managers are responsible for ensuring that their staff knows how to use approved devices 
and  software  to  connect  to  and  safely/securely  use  MyTutor’s  networks  via 
teleworking/mobile working. 
 
8.  Managers of staff for whom they have responsibility must ensure they have up to date 
contact and device information for their staff making use of teleworking / mobile working. 
 
9.  Users conducting teleworking/mobile working should not allow or give permission for 
unauthorised users (including family and friends) to use that PC/mobile device.  
 
10. Any  information  concerning  passwords,  usernames,  network  credentials  or 
requirements/ability  used  to  access  MyTutor’s  information  and  systems  by 
teleworking/mobile working must not be shared with other staff, unauthorised users, third 
party vendors, family, friends or members of the public. 
 
11. Teleworking and/or CTO distributed by MyTutor should only be used by authorised parties 
for authorised MyTutor business or purposes in accordance with MyTutor’s Acceptable Use 
Policy and associated security policies. 
 
12. Adherence to MyTutor’s Acceptable Use Policy and security policies is a requirement of 
teleworking and mobile working.  
 
13. Users should always be aware of the potential for other people (including family, friends, 
colleagues  and  intruders)  to  overlook  screens  and  keyboards  and  view  personal, 
confidential information or passwords. Users should check this is not taking place. 
 
14. During short periods of time when devices are not being used (e.g. when on the phone) 
users should lock PC's and devices to prevent screens being overlooked. For example, on 
PC's/laptops this can normally be achieved by holding down the ctrl-alt-del keys together 
and choosing the ‘lock computer’ option or by holding down the Windows (flag) key and 
hitting the L key. 
     
10220   MyTutor Teleworking and Mobile Working Procedures  2020-08-14.docx  
 
15. Users should ensure that all applications are properly closed / logged off, browsers are 
closed and internet sessions are logged off, prior to network connections being logged off 
and closed.  
 
16.  On completion of work, teleworkers/mobile workers should fully power down or log off 
remote devices. Devices should not just be suspended.  
 
17. Active equipment that is unlocked and in use should not be left unattended at any time.  
 
18. A password should be set up and used on all equipment that can be locked by use of a 
password. For example iPAQ devices can be set locked using a password and this facility 
should not be disabled by the user. 
 
19. Transfer of personal or restricted information must take place through a secure, encrypted 
channel  (identified  by  the  https  address  prefix  and  padlock  symbol)  using  suitable 
software/applications.  
 
20. Person  identifiable  information  and/or  business  data  should  not  be  stored  on  the 
PC/mobile device. If possible data should be accessed from and be stored on MyTutor’s 
servers or on password protected and encrypted portable / removable media.  
 
21. Users must not install or update any software on owned or managed devices by MyTutor.  
 
22. Users must not install any screen savers on owned or managed devices by MyTutor.  
 
23. Users must not download or install any applications or items on owned or managed 
devices by MyTutor from the internet unless official authorisation has been gained from 
the IT Department.  
 
24. Users must not alter or disable any element of the configuration of devices, including data 
encryption and anti-virus software.  
25. Only MyTutor provided removable media should be used and must be safely ‘closed’ if 
necessary and removed from any device when finished with.  
 
26. Person  identifiable  information  and  data  should  only  be  sent  using  official  channels, 
authorised software/applications and official equipment deemed fit for the purpose. For 
example, text messages containing person identifiable information and data should not be 
sent via mobile phone. 
 
27. Staff  entrusted  with  MyTutor’s  CTO  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  it  is  regularly 
connected to MyTutor network for automatic upgrade of anti-virus software and other 
software licensing agreements.  
 
28. If it is likely that a device will not be connected to MyTutor’s network for a period of 
greater than 14 days, then that device should be entrusted with a line manager for 
connection to the network for anti-virus and software licensing upgrade requirements. 
 
     
10220   MyTutor Teleworking and Mobile Working Procedures  2020-08-14.docx  
29. In the event that a user becomes aware of an information or data breach or accidental 
disclosure, this matter must be reported immediately via MyTutor’s Incident Reporting 
Procedures. 
 
5.1  5.1  Wi-Fi Security 
 
Computers and many other devices, including smart phones and PDAs, can connect to the internet 
wirelessly using Wi-Fi. An unsecured Wi-Fi connection makes it easier for hackers to access private 
files and information and it allows strangers to use the internet connection for their own purposes. 
These are general tips on changing private router and network settings. Staff may need to check the 
instructions for their wireless equipment for the technical details. If staff need more guidance on 
checking or changing settings, the Wi-Fi equipment supplier or internet provider will provide advice 
on their websites. 
 
How do I check whether my network is secure? 
 
Wi-Fi networks are accessed through a physical device called a router – also known as a hub. Staff 
will need to connect to their router to check its network settings. To do this, staff will need the 
router’s IP address, user name and password. Open the browser and enter the router’s IP address 
into the address bar. When asked, enter username and password. The router settings will allow staff 
to find out whether the connection is already secured and will let a more secure password be 
chosen. 
 
How do I secure my network? 
 
The following tips will help staff to use Wi-Fi more securely and to protect personal information.  
 
Change the wireless network’s default name 
 
A Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a unique ID used for naming wireless networks and ensures the 
network name is different to other nearby networks. Staff should change the network name from 
the router’s default. This will make it harder for anyone to identify the browser and guess its default 
settings. 
 
Use encryption  
 
Encryption scrambles messages sent over wireless networks so that they cannot be read easily. If the 
network is not encrypted then staff should enable encryption on their settings page. There are 
different forms of encryption, but MyTutor requires that staff use the Wi-Fi Protected Access 
(WPA/WPA2) version because it is stronger than other versions such as Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP) (MyTutor states staff must use WPA2.) 
 
Choose a strong password 
 
Change the password from a default supplied with the router. Make sure the password is easy to 
remember  but  would  be  difficult  for  a  stranger  to  guess  and  preferably  something  with  a 
combination of letters and numbers. Avoid using something obvious such as street name (MyTutor 
requires staff to follow its Password Policy.)  
     
10220   MyTutor Teleworking and Mobile Working Procedures  2020-08-14.docx  
 
Hide the network ID 
 
A router broadcasts its SSID to anyone within range. When the option is available staff should alter 
the router settings to not broadcast the SSID and therefore avoid alerting hackers to the network’s 
existence. 
 
Check that the device does not auto-connect to Wi-Fi signals 
 
If the device is set to automatically connect to available Wi-Fi networks then staff run the risk of 
automatically connecting to unknown and potentially dangerous networks. Staff should switch off 
auto-connect on the device settings page – refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for more details.  
. 
6 Breaches of Policy  
Breaches of this policy and/or security incidents can be defined as events which could have, or have 
resulted in, loss or damage to  MyTutor assets, or an event which is in breach of MyTutor’s security 
procedures and policies. 
All employees, partner agencies, contractors and vendors have a responsibility to report security 
incidents and breaches of this policy as quickly as possible through MyTutor’s Incident Reporting 
Procedure. This obligation also extends to any external organisation contracted to support or access 
the Information Systems of MyTutor. 
 
In the case of third party vendors, consultants or contractors non-compliance could result in the 
immediate removal of access to the system. If damage or compromise of MyTutor’s ICT systems or 
network results from the non-compliance, MyTutor will consider legal action against the third party. 
MyTutor will take appropriate measures to remedy any breach of the policy through the relevant 
frameworks in place.  In the case of an employee then the matter may be dealt with under 
MyTutor’s disciplinary process.
